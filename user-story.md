## Feature of the ng-Task-Board application

In the dashboard of the application, there are four boxes: IDEAS, RESEARS, TODO and DONE.
Users can manage their task here.
Users can change task status transferring a task by drag and drop from one box to another.

Firstly, users create tasks generating ideas in the "IDEAS" box. After generating ideas users can transfer the task into the "RESEARCH" box by drag and drop. After finishing the research, users transfer the task to the next box "TODO". Finally users keep the tasks in the "DONE" box.
